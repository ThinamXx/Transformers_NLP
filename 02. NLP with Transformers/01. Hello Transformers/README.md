**Summarization**
- The goal of text summarization is to take a long text as input and generate a short version with all the relevant facts and information.

**Question Answering**
- In question answering, we provide the model with a passage of text called the context, along with a question whose answer we'd like to extract. The model then returns the sequence of text corresponding to the answer.

**Named Entity Recognition**
- In NLP, real-world objects such as products, places and people are called named entities and extracting them from text is called named entity recognition.

**Encoder & Decoder** 
- The job of encoder is to encode the information from the input sequence into a numerical representation which is then passed to the decoder which generates the output sequence.
