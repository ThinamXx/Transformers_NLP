## **NLP Tasks with Transformers**

The [**Transformers**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/Transformers_NLP/blob/main/01.%20Transformers%20for%20NLP/04.%20NLP%20Tasks%20with%20Transformers/Transformers.ipynb) notebook contains information about Transformers, Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability, Stanford Sentiment Treebank, Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus and Winograd Schemas.

**Transformers**
- Transformers, like humans, acquire language understanding through a limited number of tasks. They detect connections through transduction and then generalize them through inductive operations.

**Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability**
- The goal is to evaluate the linguistic competence of an NLP model to judge the linguistic acceptability of a sentence. The NLP model is expected to classify the sentence accordingly.

**Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus**
- The MRPC, a GLUE task, contains pairs of sentences extracted from new sources on the web. Each pair has been annotated by a human to indicate whether the sentences are equivalent based on two closely related properties: paraphrase equivalent and semantic equivalent.
